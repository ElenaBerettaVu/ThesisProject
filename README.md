## 1. Starting guide

**Welcome!**

Hello everyone :sunny:
as you know you will soon begin your thesis project :rocket:
In order to make communications and interactions easier, especially for students going through a similar project, I have asked you all to join this work area. This way it is easier for everyone to exchange opinions
:speaking_head:, ideas:bulb:, reading suggestions:books:
The best ideas have always come to me through interactions with others so don‚Äôt be afraid to share, research arises and grows also and especially through sharing!
What you will find in this workspace:

* useful information from a bureaucratic point of view :classical_building: #4_general_info
* tips on how to best draft the thesis :book::muscle: #5_research_questions #6_thesis_structure
* tips on how to best structure your presentation :computer::muscle: #7_presentation
* things to do before you start your project :dart: [ What do to do first. ](#first)
* the best way to reach me :telephone_receiver: [ How to reach me. ](#reach)

### Instructions for Slack

How the workspace is structured :mag_right::

* I have set up two types of channels:

1. those preceded by a # and a number (for example like this: #1_starting_guide) are channels that only feature a fixed post :pushpin: (like this one) and where you cannot interact. I use them to get you useful info/tips
2. those preceded only by a # are channels where you can interact, where I will post announcements and where you can exchange opinions

* :bangbang: some channels have not yet been started/updated. I will do so in the coming months. I will notify you of updates/changes in regular posts via the #announcements channel


Some shared moments (during the project I will ask you to attend two collective group meetings :dancers::dancers:):

1. research questions meeting :question:
2. presentations meeting :computer:

_**Why?**_

* useful to get different feedback
* useful to practice giving feedback constructively
* useful to understand the feedback you will receive
* useful to learn how to work in groups with people who are not necessarily working side by side with you on the same project


I look forward to working with each of you :construction_worker:
Happy start of the project to everyone! :rocket:

## 2. How to reach me

Please **do not contact me by email**. Slack is my preferred work tool to which I am always connected during working hours (approximately 9/17).

:calendario_a_spirale: To book an appointment with me use [this link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/AcZssZ0UIotWY--1-N-QAT6DrJny_Zx6W_ODRlDvud8=).

I usually consider these appointments as online meetings. If you prefer **to meet in person**, send me a message on slack first to verify that I will be at VU on the day you want to book an appointment. My office is at the 10th floor, wing A, room 33, of the NU building.

**Culture/rules** üë©‚Äçüíª

* online or in-person meetings: you decide!
* this is your thesis, but it‚Äôs also a collaboration! :busts_in_silhouette:
* I expect you to be proactive. Don‚Äôt wait for me to be asking for an update. From the time you start the thesis I expect you to at least have a **weekly update on slack** and to book a **biweekly appointment with me**
* before your biweekly appointment prepare an agenda at least a couple of days in advance so that I can best help you. If we have meeting on Monday, get me the agenda at least Friday morning of the previous week :bookmark:
* please try to meet the deadlines I will propose during the course of the project :alarm_clock: This will ensure you finish your thesis project on time and enjoy some well-deserved vacation time next summer üèùÔ∏è

## 3. What do to do first

This section describes the **working tools** and how they should be used.

### Slack app <img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0478UF0N80/slack/7d462d2443.png" width="25">

To get the most out of slack I recommend that you add the following apps/integrations to the workspace (use the same email you used to sign up for slack):
* google calendar
* google drive
* github
  
### Overleaf :leaves:
Write your thesis with [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). If you are not familiar with it, start familiarizing yourself with the tool before you begin writing. To learn how to set up the structure see the #6_thesis_structure channel. Once you have created the file share it with me; you can use my e-mail elena.beretta@vu.nl

### Github <img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0478UF0N80/github/6030952033273d03.png" width="25">
It is easier for me to review your code from here. I will create a project on Github shortly and share it with you. All the code you use must be in the github folder. Write to me privately the email you have decided to use. For convenience I recommend that you use the same email address for all tools, including slack

### Google Drive <img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0478UF0N80/google-drive/1b5371cac20a4325.png" width="25">
Create a folder in your google drive and name it like this:
```
Name_surname_course_academic year
Example:
Elena_Beretta_AI_2023
```
Inside create the following subfolders:
* thesis: where you will put drafts and other files related to the writing
* presentation: where you will put files related to the final presentation
* bibliography: where you will put the pdfs of the articles you have read/are going to use in the thesis. Please name the pdfs you place with the original title of the paper. This way it is easier for me to keep track of what you are reading/find a relevant article that you point out to me

Once you have created the folder on drive share it with me (as before, use elena.beretta@vu.nl) and be sure to give me editor permissions; from time to time I might upload interesting things/articles to the folder

### Google form <img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0478UF0N80/google-forms/d8327670b1b047cd.png" width="25">
Once you have completed all of these steps, please fill out [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfEXOOtH-ObOQNlUWbiDEGYZdAQxB4YmZCR8BvbwWzNtDuIeQ/viewform) (but not before I have created your directory on github). I need this to collect all your links in one place
