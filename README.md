## 1. Starting guide

**Welcome!**

Hello everyone :sunny:
as you know you will soon begin your thesis project :rocket:
In order to make communications and interactions easier, especially for students going through a similar project, I ask you all to join [this work area](https://join.slack.com/t/thesis-project-gruppo/shared_invite/zt-2w9kbtsi9-RV0HFQFNhnXpLOOT97tCew). This way it is easier for everyone to exchange opinions
:speaking_head:, ideas:bulb:, reading suggestions:books:
The best ideas have always come to me through interactions with others so don‚Äôt be afraid to share, research arises and grows also and especially through sharing!

I look forward to working with each of you :construction_worker:
Happy start of the project to everyone! :rocket:

## 2. How to reach me

Please **do not contact me by email**. Slack is my preferred work tool to which I am always connected during working hours (approximately 9/17).

üóì To book an appointment with me use [this link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/AcZssZ0UIotWY--1-N-QAT6DrJny_Zx6W_ODRlDvud8=).

I usually consider these appointments as online meetings. If you prefer **to meet in person**, send me a message on slack first to verify that I will be at VU on the day you want to book an appointment. My office is at the 10th floor, wing A, room 61, of the NU building.

**Culture/rules** üë©‚Äçüíª

* online or in-person meetings: you decide!
* this is your thesis, but it‚Äôs also a collaboration! :busts_in_silhouette:
* I expect you to be proactive. Don‚Äôt wait for me to be asking for an update. From the time you start the thesis I expect you to at least have a **weekly update on slack** and to book a **biweekly appointment with me**. I will give feedback during our biweekly meetings
* before your biweekly appointment prepare an agenda at least a couple of days in advance so that I can best help you. If we have meeting on Monday, get me the agenda at least Friday morning of the previous week :bookmark:
* please try to meet the deadlines I will propose during the course of the project :alarm_clock: This will ensure you finish your thesis project on time and enjoy some well-deserved vacation time next summer üèùÔ∏è

## 3. What do to do first

This section describes the **working tools** and how they should be used.

### Slack app <img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0478UF0N80/slack/7d462d2443.png" width="25">

To get the most out of slack I recommend that you add the following apps/integrations to the workspace (use the same email you used to sign up for slack):
* google calendar
* google drive
* github
  
### Overleaf :leaves:
Write your thesis with [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). If you are not familiar with it, start familiarizing yourself with the tool before you begin writing. Once you have created the file share it with me; you can use my e-mail elena.beretta@vu.nl

### Github <img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0478UF0N80/github/6030952033273d03.png" width="25">
It is easier for me to review your code from here. I will create a project on Github shortly and share it with you. All the code you use must be in the github folder. Write to me privately the email you have decided to use. For convenience I recommend that you use the same email address for all tools, including slack

### Google Drive <img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0478UF0N80/google-drive/1b5371cac20a4325.png" width="25">
Create a folder in your google drive and name it like this:
```
Name_surname_course_academic year
Example:
Elena_Beretta_masterAI_2023
```
Inside create the following subfolders:
* thesis: where you will put drafts and other files related to the writing
* presentation: where you will put files related to the final presentation
* bibliography: where you will put the pdfs of the articles you have read/are going to use in the thesis. Please name the pdfs you place with the original title of the paper. This way it is easier for me to keep track of what you are reading/find a relevant article that you point out to me

Once you have created the folder on drive share it with me (as before, use elena.beretta@vu.nl) and be sure to give me editor permissions; from time to time I might upload interesting things/articles to the folder

### Google form <img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0478UF0N80/google-forms/d8327670b1b047cd.png" width="25">
Once you have completed all of these steps, please fill out [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfEXOOtH-ObOQNlUWbiDEGYZdAQxB4YmZCR8BvbwWzNtDuIeQ/viewform). I need this to collect all your links in one place.

## 4. Research Design and Timeline

The first thing to do to begin your thesis project is to draft a Research Design. As a rule, it is always best to send me a non-final version and give me time to correct. Within the Research Design should be included clear research questions and in the methodology a concrete idea of how you intend to answer the research questions.

Below you will find some general information about the timeline to follow if you want to execute the thesis project in no more than 5 months:
* **month 1**: project plan, bibliography construction, data retrieval or dataset construction (depending on the project)
* **months 2, 3**: deployment
* **month 4**: evaluation and analysis of results
* **month 4, 5**: thesis writing and final delivery
* thesis presentation may be at the end of month 5 or in the following month depending on faculty availability

:exclamation: Some important things to keep in mind:
* **agree with me on clear deadlines** :date:
* to proofread your work and give you useful feedback I need time, and proofreading your work is not my exclusive responsibility. Be sure to send me your work on time :alarm_clock:
* do not assume that I will always be there. Generally the months when I am away for vacation or personal reasons are August, September and December. As a rule, do not assume that I am always present, or that my colleagues are, if you do not meet agreed deadlines :desert_island:

### 4.1 Project Plan
The project plan should include the following sections:

**Introduction** - Start with a brief introduction into the problem that your research will address, or the novel insights it is intended to yield, convincing the reader of the societal and scientific relevance of the task. If you do an external internship, also give the context of the internship provider. The intro may end with one or more research questions and/or a problem statement.
**Related work** - Discuss the scientific literature that addresses the same or a similar problem as your study, and make clear how your study relates and adds to this body of research. Try to give a broad but concise overview of the ways in which the problem is approached in other studies. 
**Methodology** - Specify and motivate the proposed approach(es) that you will implement / apply. If it includes a pipeline or architecture, it makes sense to give a rough visualization and description.
**Experimental set-up** - Describe what the experiment(s) will look like. Depending on your study, it can include information like:
* Research design
* Dataset (including information on source, size, labelling, etc., to the extent available)
* The different variations of the approach that you will compare, as well as details on how they will be applied (library, parameter tuning, etc.) 
* Participants (numbers, intended characteristics)
* Experimental procedure
* Evaluation procedure / metrics
**Planning** - Specify the different stages of your research, and their intended duration. You are free to choose how you want to display the planning. A gantt chart is a popular way to do so, as it can represent overlap between stages. Make sure to book in writing throughout the trajectory, and it is advisable to count back from the intended end date of your thesis to know when you would like to finalize your concept version and when the experimentation should be finished to make this happen.

The project plan should be no longer than 4 pages, excluding references.
