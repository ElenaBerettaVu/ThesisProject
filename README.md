## 1. Starting guide

**Welcome!**

Hello everyone :sunny:
as you know you will soon begin your thesis project :rocket:
In order to make communications and interactions easier, especially for students going through a similar project, I have asked you all to join this work area. This way it is easier for everyone to exchange opinions :speaking_head_in_silhouette:, ideas:bulb:, reading suggestions:books:
The best ideas have always come to me through interactions with others so don’t be afraid to share, research arises and grows also and especially through sharing!
What you will find in this workspace:

* useful information from a bureaucratic point of view :classical_building: #4_general_info
* tips on how to best draft the thesis :book::muscle: #5_research_questions #6_thesis_structure
* tips on how to best structure your presentation :computer::muscle: #7_presentation
* things to do before you start your project :dart: #3_what_to_do_first
* how to reach me :telephone_receiver: #2_how_to_reach_me


How the workspace is structured :mag_right::

* I have set up two types of channels:

1. those preceded by a # and a number (for example like this: #1_starting_guide) are channels that only feature a fixed post :pushpin: (like this one) and where you cannot interact. I use them to get you useful info/tips
2. those preceded only by a # are channels where you can interact, where I will post announcements and where you can exchange opinions

* :bangbang: some channels have not yet been started/updated. I will do so in the coming months. I will notify you of updates/changes in regular posts via the #announcements channel


Some shared moments (during the project I will ask you to attend two collective group meetings :dancers::dancers:):

1. research questions meeting :question:
2. presentations meeting :computer:

_**Why?**_

* useful to get different feedback
* useful to practice giving feedback constructively
* useful to understand the feedback you will receive
* useful to learn how to work in groups with people who are not necessarily working side by side with you on the same project


I look forward to working with each of you :construction_worker:
Happy start of the project to everyone! :rocket:

## 2. How to reach me

Please **do not contact me by email**. Slack is my preferred work tool to which I am always connected during working hours (approximately 9/17).

:calendario_a_spirale: To book an appointment with me use [this link]([url](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/AcZssZ0UIotWY--1-N-QAT6DrJny_Zx6W_ODRlDvud8=)).

I usually consider these appointments as online meetings. If you prefer to meet in person, send me a message on slack first to verify that I will be at VU on the day you want to book an appointment. My office is at the 10th floor, wing A, room 33, of the NU building.

**Culture/rules** :informatico_donna:
online or in-person meetings: you decide!
this is your thesis, but it’s also a collaboration! :profilo_di_busti:
I expect you to be proactive. Don’t wait for me to be asking for an update. From the time you start the thesis I expect you to at least have a weekly update on slack and to book a biweekly appointment with me
before your biweekly appointment prepare an agenda at least a couple of days in advance so that I can best help you. If we have meeting on Monday, get me the agenda at least Friday morning of the previous week :segnalibro:
please try to meet the deadlines I will propose during the course of the project :sveglia: This will ensure you finish your thesis project on time and enjoy some well-deserved vacation time next summer :isola_deserta:
