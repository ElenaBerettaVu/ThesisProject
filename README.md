# ThesisProject


**Welcome!**
Hello everyone :sunny:
as you know you will soon begin your thesis project :rocket:
In order to make communications and interactions easier, especially for students going through a similar project, I have asked you all to join this work area. This way it is easier for everyone to exchange opinions :speaking_head_in_silhouette:, ideas:bulb:, reading suggestions:books:
The best ideas have always come to me through interactions with others so don’t be afraid to share, research arises and grows also and especially through sharing!
What you will find in this workspace:

* useful information from a bureaucratic point of view :classical_building: #4_general_info
* tips on how to best draft the thesis :book::muscle: #5_research_questions #6_thesis_structure
* tips on how to best structure your presentation :computer::muscle: #7_presentation
* things to do before you start your project :dart: #3_what_to_do_first
* how to reach me :telephone_receiver: #2_how_to_reach_me


How the workspace is structured :mag_right::

* I have set up two types of channels:

1. those preceded by a # and a number (for example like this: #1_starting_guide) are channels that only feature a fixed post :pushpin: (like this one) and where you cannot interact. I use them to get you useful info/tips
2. those preceded only by a # are channels where you can interact, where I will post announcements and where you can exchange opinions

* :bangbang: some channels have not yet been started/updated. I will do so in the coming months. I will notify you of updates/changes in regular posts via the #announcements channel


Some shared moments (during the project I will ask you to attend two collective group meetings :dancers::dancers:):

1. research questions meeting :question:
2. presentations meeting :computer:

_**Why?**_

* useful to get different feedback
* useful to practice giving feedback constructively
* useful to understand the feedback you will receive
* useful to learn how to work in groups with people who are not necessarily working side by side with you on the same project


I look forward to working with each of you :construction_worker:
Happy start of the project to everyone! :rocket:
